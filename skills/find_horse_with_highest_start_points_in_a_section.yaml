title: Find the horse with the highest start start_points in a section
description: This skill finds the horse with the highest start points in a section.
Example questions:
  - Vilken häst har bäst form?
---
workflow:
  - step: 1
    description: "Identify the section you are interested in. The data is for a single round, so you only need to specify the section number."
    required_fields:
      - section.number
  - step: 2
    description: "Once the section is identified, this code ranks the horses by their start points in descending order and identifies the horse with the highest score."
    required_fields:
      - data.starters.horse.section_number
      - data.starters.horse.start_points
      - data.starters.horse.horse_name
    code example: |
      section_number = 1  # Example section number
      starters_in_section = [s for s in data['starters'] if s['horse']['section_number'] == section_number]

      if not starters_in_section:
          print(f"No starters found in section {section_number}.")
      else:
          # Sort the starters by start_points in descending order
          ranked_starters = sorted(starters_in_section, key=lambda s: s['horse']['start_points'], reverse=True)

          print(f"Ranked list of horses in section {section_number} by start points:")
          for i, starter in enumerate(ranked_starters):
              rank = i + 1
              horse_name = starter['horse']['horse_name']
              start_points = starter['horse']['start_points']
              is_highest = " (Highest)" if i == 0 else ""
              print(f"{rank}. {horse_name} - Start points: {start_points}{is_highest}")
